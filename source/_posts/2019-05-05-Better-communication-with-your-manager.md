## Overview
This blog notes down something I learned recently about communication with managers. Nobody can read your mind, neither can they understand you better than yourself. With better communications, managers understand your strengths/needs/abilities better, and you career grows faster and happier.

First of all, the definition of management is concise, it differenciates `leader` and `manager`.


```Definition of a management:```

>Management is not a promotion, it is a lateral move for people who want to get work done through and grow and develop others


The refreshing definition is also impressive, you can find a pretty good article about this in [1] of the [Resources](##Resources)
## Strength v.s. Weakness
1. Strength is not something that you are **good** at, A strength is an activity:
  * that strengths you. 
  * that you loo forward to doing.
  * that leaves you energized, rather than depleted

  
2. Similar to strength, weakness is not something that you are **bad** at neither, but something that we hate doing. 

## Situational leadership

### Development Levels

For the development levels, it categorizes tasks(__not the people__) by two metrics, `competence` and `commitment`, considering low and high for each metrics, we have different combinations

#### 1. Competence

 * Demonstrated **ability** and **transferable knowledge** to do a task

#### 2. Commitment

 * **Motivation** and **confidence** on a specific task

 
#### 3. Different stage
| Stage | Competence       | Commitment | Name                  |
|-------|------------------|------------|-----------------------|
| D1    | Low              | High       | Enthusiastic Beginner |
| D2    | Low to Some      | Low        | Disillusioned Learner |
| D3    | Moderate to High | Variable   | Cautious Performer    |
| D4    | High             | High       | Self-Reliant Achiever |

For different tasks of different stages above, it requires different supports. For example, people at `D4` require more sharing to get the sense of accomplishment. People at `D1` may require some hand-by-hand coaching, even micro-manangement here is needed.

### Leadership Styles

For the leadership part, there are also two metrics, `Directive` and `Supportive` Behaviour.

#### 1. Directive behaviour

 * __What and How__: Give direction/Tell you what to do

#### 2. Supportive behaviour

 * __Develope commitment, initiative, and positive attitudes__: Provide encouragement, coaching and support

#### 3. Different leadership styles
| Style | Directive | Supportive | Name       |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| S1    | High      | Low        | Directing  |
| S2    | High      | High       | Coaching   |
| S3    | Low       | High       | Supporting |
| S4    | Low       | Low        | Delegating |


### Match Development levels with Leadership styles

| Stage | Competence       | Commitment | Leadership            | Development| Directive | Supportive | Style |
|-------|------------------|------------|-----------------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| D1    | Low              | High       | Enthusiastic Beginner | Directing  | High      | Low        | S1    |
| D2    | Low to Some      | Low        | Disillusioned Learner | Coaching   | High      | High       | S2    |
| D3    | Moderate to High | Variable   | Cautious Performer    | Supporting | Low       | High       | S3    |
| D4    | High             | High       | Self-Reliant Achiever | Delegating | Low       | Low        | S4    |
