1. [2018-11-26]Uber ride in a raining day
I was taking an Uber from Broadway to Grand Central, then I noticed the driver was frustrating about a new dispatch. The passengers were were standing in the middle of the trip. We saw those passengers in the middle of the trip too! But the driver could not pick them up since I called an UberX instead of Uber Pool. That means the driver had to drive back to the passengers after dropping me off and the passengers had to wait in the cold rain for ~13 minutes.
Right after we passed the passengers from next dispatch, I told the driver to let them in the car, so they would not stand in the rain and the driver needn't to drive back to pick them up.
It turned out they are three visitors from Virginia to NYC to celebrate Christmas and a grandma of them came here to see her grandson. We had a pleasant conversation in the car and they thanked me a lot.
A small and quick idea makes two groups of people happy, this really made my day!
On my way back, I was thinking why would Uber dispatch system do such stupid assignment even after the driver declined it once. I am assuming one (over)important metric during their algorithm development is batch size of the request, they want to batch the as many requests as possible so that the driver won't be idle. Maybe there are some other metrics they should consider.
